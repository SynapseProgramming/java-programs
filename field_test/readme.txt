a class field is basically an object/variable which is associated with the class name. 
It does not belong to any instance of the class(object ). 
A class field is defined using the keyword static 
To access a class field, you would have to add the class name in front of the . specifier aka Math.PI

Example test code in this file:
1.) Class counter would have a single class field inside(aka count.)
2.) member functions to get and set this class field
3.) The main class would create multiple instances of the counter class. We can see if the class field is actually shared globally.
