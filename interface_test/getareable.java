/*
functions defined in interfaces are abstract and public by default.
for pure interfaces, classes would have to implement them. Otherwise, there would be some error.

Interfaces can only contain abstract functions
and member variables. 
They do not have constructors as they cant be instantiated.
Interfaces are pure abstract classes.
